    // Unique u1 = u2;
    //
    // and u1 would be assigned u2's id!  We could also use the copy assignment
    // operator like this:
    //
    // u1 = u2;
    //
    // and again u1 would be assigned u2's id.  The problem is that we want our
    // objects to each have a unique id, so supporting either of these operations
    // doesn't make sense given they would cause a bug for our program's logic
    // (though not a compiler error).

    // the copy assignment operator using the "= delete;" specifier.  We call

    // error to occur signalling to the developer/writer that they're doing
    // something they shouldnt' be!
