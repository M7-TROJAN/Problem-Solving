# ProblemSolving

Welcome to the **ProblemSolving** repository! Here, I've documented my journey of solving over +2000 problems and multiple projects. This endeavor has not only honed my skills but also expanded my knowledge base and prepared me for technical interviews. If you're wondering how to learn programming the right way and avoid pitfalls, I've summarized my insights below.

## How to Learn Programming the Right Way

1. **Surround Yourself with Positivity**: Steer clear of negative influences. Avoid those who discourage you with statements like "it's too hard," "it has no future," or "you won't find jobs." Seek guidance from successful individuals who've made a mark in the field.

2. **Distinguish Programming from Programming Languages**: Understand that programming involves logic, analysis, and problem-solving. Programming languages are tools to apply your logic and thinking. Master programming itself, as languages can be learned quickly once you possess strong programming fundamentals.

3. **Begin with Fundamental Languages**: Avoid modern programming languages initially. They often provide ready-made functions and tools that hinder your logical growth. Just like students learn math concepts before relying on calculators, start with languages like C++, Java, or Python to build your programming foundation.

4. **Focus on Fundamentals First**:
   - Learn the chosen programming language's fundamentals.
   - Solve a minimum of 2000 problems to refine your skills and logic.
   - Delay diving into other topics until you've solved around 500 to 700 problems. This phase will solidify your understanding.

5. **Expand Your Knowledge**:
   - After solving a substantial number of problems (around 2000), spend a month learning a modern programming language.
   - Dedicate 1 to 3 weeks to grasp the basics of Databases.
   - Undertake your first project; consider starting with a desktop application like University Registration. Begin with a simple version and gradually enhance its functionality.

By following these steps, you'll gain the confidence and expertise to explore new technologies, languages, and fields of interest.
