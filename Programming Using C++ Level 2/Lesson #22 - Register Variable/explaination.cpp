/* Lesson 22: Register Variables :

Types of Memory:
-Hard disk (slowest)
-RAM (faster)
-Cache Memory (faster)
-Register(سجلً) (closest to cpu) (Fastest)

Note1: Back in C++, you could define a variable of the type of CPU registers,
And then reserve a place for it in the CPU registers.

Note2: These things were used for things that needed very high speed.

Note3: This thing has been canceled since the C++ version (2011) until now.
Note4: The reason is that dealing with(التعامل مع) it is very difficult and it is not a joke,
because the CPU registers are the most expensive thing for the device in terms(من ناحية) of speed, efficiency(كفاءة), etc...
